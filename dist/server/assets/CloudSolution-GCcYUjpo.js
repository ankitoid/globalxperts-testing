It includes resources and tools designed to streamline the migration process and reduce associated costs."},{question:"How does AWS support cloud migration?",answer:"AWS facilitates cloud migration through tools such as the Application Migration Service (MGN) and the Database Migration Service (DMS), complemented by expert guidance from AWS Professional Services. These resources enable a smooth transition to the cloud, allowing organizations to benefit from AWS's scalability, security, and cost-effectiveness."},{question:"What is the Prolific I/O – Storage Accelerator?",answer:"The Prolific I/O – Storage Accelerator is a solution that addresses workloads requiring high throughput or IOPS during peak periods. It enhances throughput and IOPS capacity only when demand is elevated, thereby reducing costs associated with idle capacity during low-demand periods."},{question:"How can I save money during migration to AWS?",answer:"To achieve cost savings during migration, organizations can utilize the Migration Acceleration Program (MAP), which offers financial assistance. Additionally, the Prolific I/O – Storage Accelerator can optimize resource use and manage costs related to variable workload demands."},{question:"What should I do if my workloads experience performance issues on AWS?",answer:"In cases of performance degradation due to workload spikes on AWS, implementing the Prolific I/O – Storage Accelerator is advisable.
